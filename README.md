## Introduction  
This project focuses on the development of a controller for music playback through a Buzzer module on a Raspberry Pi board.  

## Necessary materials  
•⁠  ⁠Raspberry Pi Pico.  
•⁠  ⁠Buzzer.  
•⁠  ⁠Breadboard.  
•⁠  ⁠USB Wire.  
•⁠  ⁠Thonny (IDE).  


## Assembly

The Buzzer connects to the GPIO (General Purpose Input and Output) pins of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
